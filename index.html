      <p>
        Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD) was a Roman Emperor and one of the most respected Stoic philosophers in history. As the last of the "Five Good Emperors," his leadership combined wisdom, discipline, and introspection during times of war and plague.
      </p>
      <p>
        His most well-known work, <em>Meditations</em>, wasn’t written for an audience, it was written as personal reflections on how to live a virtuous and rational life. These entries remain some of the most influential texts in the self-growth and personal development world today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marcus lived by the principle that we cannot control external events, only our own thoughts and actions. His ability to remain composed in the face of adversity has made him a timeless role model for resilience, emotional discipline, and inner clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        His teachings align closely with Paradox Free values: don't fear uncertainty, use it. Make your decisions grounded in integrity, and trust that there are no wrong choices, only clear actions.
